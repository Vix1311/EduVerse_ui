## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git**

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/elearning-ui.git
   cd elearning-ui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment** Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
   VITE_NODE_ENV=development
   ```

   - `VITE_API_URL`: Set to your backend API (e.g., Node.js/Express server).
   - Ensure the backend is running for full functionality.

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to view the app.

5. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Serve the `dist/` folder using a static server (e.g., `npm run preview`).

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **API Errors**: Verify the backend server is running and `VITE_API_URL` is correct.
- **Port Conflicts**: Vite defaults to port `4000`. Change it in `vite.config.ts` if needed.
- **Dependency Issues**: Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall.
- **Browser Caching**: Clear browser cache if UI updates don’t appear.

## ✨ Core Functionalities

### 🔐 User Authentication

A clean login and registration interface with role-based navigation.

- **UI**: Ant Design forms with validation.
- **State**: Redux Toolkit manages auth tokens and user data.

---

### 📚 Course Browsing

Explore courses with dynamic filters, search, and grid/list views.

- **UI**: Ant Design Cards and Table components.
- **State**: Redux Toolkit for caching course data.
- **Example**:
  ```jsx
  <CourseCard
    title="JavaScript Mastery"
    instructor="John Doe"
    price={49.99}
    onEnroll={handleEnroll}
  />
  ```

---

### 📋 Enrollment Dashboard

View enrolled courses, track progress, and download certificates.

- **UI**: Ant Design Progress and Timeline components.
- **State**: Redux Toolkit for real-time progress updates.

---

### 🎨 Responsive Design

Seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

- **UI**: Ant Design’s grid system and responsive utilities.
- **Example**: Layout adapts dynamically to screen size.
